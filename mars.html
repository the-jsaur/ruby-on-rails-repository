<h2>The Dull Brown Planet</h2>
<p class="desc"> Mars lost its atmosphere (and oceans) a long time ago, so it's currently a major target for exploration, as we think we can learn more about the solar system and out origins with it. It's also a popular target for colonization mission plans, though those have been continually delayed. </p>
