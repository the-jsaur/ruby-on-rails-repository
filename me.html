<h2> What Is This? </h2>
<p class="desc"> You are currently looking at the result of a specific set of computer instructions known as an HTML file. While in many cases, these files are sent between computers and maintained as a permanent "location" on the Earth's inter-computer network, this file is standalone and is inaccessible from outside my personal computing device. </p>


<h2> About Me </h2>
<img class="image" src="me.jpg" title="I don't usually take pictures of myself, so I had to do one just right now." alt="I don't usually take pictures of myself, so I had to do one just right now." width="400" height="260">


<p class="desc"> I am an adolescent human (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) male currently residing on the third planet "Earth" orbiting a G-class main sequence star somewhere in the Gould Belt. When not undergoing mandatory educational processes, I can usually be found on the digital computing devices that have become prevalent in Earth's recent history. I hope to ultimately study astronomy or astrophysics so I can learn about the universe around me. </p>
